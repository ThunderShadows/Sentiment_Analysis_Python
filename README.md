# Sentiment_Analysis_Python

# Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on the Amazon reviews dataset by integrating two powerful techniques: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and the RoBERTa pretrained model from Hugging Face. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both methods to achieve accurate sentiment classification of product reviews.

# Project Description
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text. In this project, we focus on analyzing Amazon product reviews, which can provide valuable insights into customer opinions and product performance.

# Techniques Used
VADER-
VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text but is also effective for other domains, including product reviews. It uses a combination of a sentiment lexicon and grammatical rules to assess the sentiment of text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. VADER is particularly adept at handling sentiments expressed in a concise manner, making it suitable for short reviews.

RoBERTa-
RoBERTa is a robustly optimized version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and is known for its superior performance in various NLP tasks. By fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on the Amazon reviews dataset, we can capture complex patterns and contextual nuances in the text, leading to improved sentiment classification.

# Implementation Steps
Data Collection: Gather the Amazon reviews dataset, which contains user reviews along with their corresponding ratings, consisting reviews upto 50,000.

Preprocessing: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Dataset along with checking NLTK Tools like POS(Parts-Of-Speech).

VADER Analysis: Apply VADER to perform initial sentiment scoring on the reviews, providing a baseline sentiment classification.Mathematically summing up the positive/neutral/negative reviews and providing the answer.

RoBERTa Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning the online RoBERTa model on the labeled dataset to enhance sentiment prediction capabilities. The pretrained model provides approximately accurate results dervied from Twitter Posts reviews.

Integration: Combine the results from VADER and RoBERTa to create a hybrid model that utilizes the strengths of both approaches for more accurate sentiment analysis.

Comparison: Assess the performance of the hybrid model using metrics and variables such as roberta_pos and vader_pos.

# Requirements
Python 3.0 


Libraries: nltk, transformers, pandas, numpy, ipywidgets, seaborn, matplotlib 


Access to the Amazon reviews dataset through Kaggle

# Conclusion
By integrating VADER and RoBERTa, this project aims to provide a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution that can effectively interpret customer sentiments in Amazon reviews. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of sentiment classification but also demonstrates the potential of combining traditional and modern NLP techniques.
